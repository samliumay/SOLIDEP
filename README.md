## Single Responsibility Principle
* "Every Software component should have one and only one responsibility." 
* At the explanation above, you can see 'component' part. this part is critical for us. It can mean class,method or a module at this context.
* Basically you can not write a component like a swiss army knife. In the software world, the part that you use to cut the apple have higher chance to cut your hand than an apple.
